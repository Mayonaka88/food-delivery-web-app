# Food Delivery Web App
> A food delivery web app created in 2022 as a project for my Web Development course in the British University in Dubai.

> C#, ASP.NET, SQL, and HTML/CSS were used in this project.

> The application is presented in a form of a restaurant menu on a food delivery app.

> Users can add food items into thier cart and place thier order.

> The food item list can be added to or deleted from or cleared entirely.

> The bill is presented to show the prices of the food items and the total amount owed.

> Run FoodApp.sln to start.
